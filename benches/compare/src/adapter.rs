//! Thin adapter over the `orderbook-rs` API surface this harness calls.
//!
//! `workloads.rs` is byte-identical whichever side of the comparison it
//! is compiled for; every version-specific detail lives here, isolated
//! behind the `v0_13` / `head` Cargo features selected by
//! `scripts/bench_compare.sh`. The two arms differ in exactly one call
//! today (#259): `OrderBook::create_snapshot` returns the snapshot on
//! `v0.13.1` and a `Result` on HEAD (0.14.0), so [`create_snapshot`]
//! is the one diverging function. Everything else the workloads call
//! (`add_limit_order_with_user`, `submit_market_order_with_user`,
//! `cancel_order`, `cancel_all_orders`, `with_stp_mode`,
//! `with_trade_and_price_level_listener`, `create_snapshot_package` /
//! `restore_from_snapshot_package`, `get_order`, the sequencer's
//! `InMemoryJournal` / `ReplayEngine::replay_from`) has the same
//! signature on both tags (checked against `v0.13.1` during #259). The
//! identical parts live in [`common`] so a future divergence is a
//! one-function move into the two arms, not a rewrite of the workloads.
//!
//! Every scenario submits and cancels with a `user_id` (never the
//! userless `add_limit_order` / `submit_market_order` paths), matching
//! the headline `benches/order_book/*_hdr.rs` shape exactly — a PR
//! review on #258 caught `cancel_only` diverging from
//! `cancel_only_hdr`'s `submit_gtc` (which always attaches an owner),
//! which meant this crate was comparing a different book/index shape
//! than the scenario it claims to mirror.
//!
//! # `owner` returns `[u8; 32]`, not `pricelevel::Hash32`
//!
//! `add_limit_order_with_user` / `submit_market_order_with_user` take
//! `user: [u8; 32]` and convert with `.into()` at the call site, letting
//! type inference resolve to *whichever* `Hash32` the active
//! `orderbook-rs` path dependency's own `pricelevel` edge provides.
//! This crate tried a direct `pricelevel` dependency during #258 review
//! to name `Hash32` explicitly and reverted it (see `Cargo.toml`'s doc
//! comment): `v0.13.1` and HEAD pin semver-incompatible `pricelevel`
//! minors (`0.9` / `0.10`), so a version range wide enough to match
//! both does not make Cargo unify on one of them — it resolves this
//! crate's own direct edge independently (to the newest match) from
//! `orderbook-rs`'s transitive edge, yielding two incompatible copies
//! of the crate and a type-mismatch on every `Hash32` argument.
//! `From<[u8; 32]> for Hash32` is present in both `0.9.2` and `0.10.0`,
//! so passing a plain array and converting through the callee's own
//! resolved type sidesteps the whole problem — this file never needs
//! to name `Hash32` at all.
