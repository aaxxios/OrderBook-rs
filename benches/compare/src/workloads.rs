//! The headline scenarios from `benches/order_book/*_hdr.rs` (plus a
//! snapshot, a replay and a contended scenario), reimplemented against
//! `crate::adapter` so the exact same source runs against two different
//! `orderbook-rs` checkouts (issues #258 / #259).
//!
//! Each scenario returns a `Histogram<u64>` of per-op nanosecond
//! latencies. Only the operation under test is timed (#259 PR review):
//!
//! - every op's inputs (ids, prices, quantities, sides, owners, the op
//!   kind of the mixed stream) are drawn **before** the clock starts;
//! - every op's output (the returned order, match result, cancel result
//!   or mass-cancel result) is kept and dropped **after** the clock
//!   stops ([`record`] returns it; [`record_batch_into`] pushes it into a
//!   buffer reserved before the clock, one `Vec::push` per op);
//! - seeding, refills and setup-time assertions run outside the clock.
//!
//! Scenarios whose single op is at or near the host clock tick (about
//! 41.67 ns on Apple silicon) use [`record_batch_into`], which times
//! `BATCH` ops per `Instant` pair and records the per-op average;
//! scenarios well above the tick use [`record`], one sample per op.
