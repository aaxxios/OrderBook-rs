/// process and across restarts, so that two books never issue the same
/// trade ID. It is a UUIDv5 over non-panicking inputs:
///
/// 1. `symbol_ns = v5(root, symbol)`, where `root = v5(NAMESPACE_OID,
///    "orderbook-rs/default-trade-id-namespace")`;
/// 2. `namespace = v5(symbol_ns, pid ‖ wall_ns ‖ seq)`: the process id
///    ([`std::process::id`], 4 bytes LE), the wall clock in nanoseconds
///    since the UNIX epoch (16 bytes LE; `0` if the clock reads before the
///    epoch) and a process-wide construction counter (8 bytes LE).
///
/// Uniqueness argument:
///
/// - **Same process.** `seq` is taken with an atomic `fetch_update` +
///   `checked_add`, so every construction sees a distinct value, whatever
///   the thread, symbol or clock reading.
/// - **Concurrent processes.** Live processes have distinct pids.
/// - **Restarts.** A restarted process sees a later wall clock (and
///   usually a different pid), so `(pid, wall_ns, seq)` differs from every
///   tuple of the earlier run unless the clock was stepped back to the same
///   nanosecond while the OS handed out the same pid again. A clock that
///   reads before the epoch contributes `0`, leaving restart uniqueness to
///   the pid for as long as the clock stays broken.
/// - **Hash.** Distinct names map to distinct UUIDv5 values except for a
///   SHA-1 collision over 122 bits, negligible for non-adversarial input.
///
/// Counter exhaustion: after `u64::MAX` constructions in one process
/// (about 584 years at one book per nanosecond) `checked_add` refuses to
/// advance, `seq` stays at `u64::MAX`, a `WARN` is logged and uniqueness
/// then rests on the nanosecond wall clock alone. Nothing panics or wraps.

/// pricelevel 0.10 supports **exactly one concurrent writer** of a level's
/// execution aggregates (`orders_executed`, `quantity_executed`,
/// `value_executed`, `last_execution_time`, `sum_waiting_time`, and the
/// `stats_degraded` flag the recorder sets): its sequence guard protects
/// readers, it is not a writer lock.
///
/// The book does not serialize sweeps to provide that single writer. Two
/// sweeps that both hold the shared side of the submit gate may match at
/// the same price level at the same time, and each calls pricelevel's
/// `record_execution` for its own fills. That is the case for every
/// non-fill-or-kill taker and every matching-capable modify on an
/// [`STPMode::None`] book, and for anonymous (`Hash32::zero()`) match-only
/// sweeps such as [`match_order`](Self::match_order) under any mode, as long
/// as no strandable maker rests. Fill-or-kill takers, STP-relevant submits
/// and sweeps in a book holding a strandable maker run exclusively, so they
/// never overlap another recorder.
///
/// While two recorders overlap on one level, a snapshot of that level can
/// capture a **partial execution**: for example `orders_executed` already
/// counting a fill whose `quantity_executed` / `value_executed` has not
/// landed yet. The contract is therefore:
///
/// - **Exact regardless of concurrency:** trades, `MatchResult`,
///   `TradeResult` (fees included), every level's queue, quantities, order
///   count and order vector, and the order-admission / removal counters
///   (`orders_added`, `orders_removed`, plain atomic increments). None of them
///   is derived from the execution aggregates.
/// - **Exact once the overlapping sweeps return:** the execution aggregates
///   themselves. Every counter update is an atomic checked read-modify-write
///   and a rollback subtracts exactly what its own call added, so the next
///   snapshot taken with no sweep in flight on that level reads the true
///   totals. A snapshot read never hangs: the sequence is never left odd
///   once the writers stop.
/// - **Advisory while sweeps are in flight:** execution aggregates captured
///   concurrently with shared-gate takers may lag or be torn across fields.
///   Use them for monitoring, not for accounting or cross-field invariants
///   (for example `value_executed / quantity_executed` as an average price).
///   A snapshot package captured in that window checksums and, on
///   [`restore_from_snapshot_package`](Self::restore_from_snapshot_package),
///   installs those values verbatim; the checksum certifies integrity, not
///   coherence.
///
/// For exact statistics, capture snapshots while no sweep is in flight, or
/// drive the book from a single submitting thread (as a sequencer does).
/// Replay is single-threaded and always exact; see
/// `sequencer::snapshots_match` for why its statistics comparison is sound.
/// This is a documented trade-off (decision D6): serializing ordinary
/// sweeps would cost throughput on every book to fix a monitoring-only
/// field. The book-derived analytics ([`depth_statistics`](Self::depth_statistics),
/// the enriched snapshot metrics, market-impact simulation) read prices and
/// quantities only and are unaffected.
///
/// # Listener delivery (#249)
///
/// The trade, price-level and order-state listeners run **after** the
/// mutation that produced their events has committed and the submit gate
/// has been released, never mid-mutation or under a book lock. Per book,
/// deliveries form one total order consistent with commit order: the
/// `engine_seq` of trade and price-level events strictly increases across
/// the delivered stream, also with concurrent submitters, and a single
/// submitting thread sees exactly the order it saw before 0.14.0. Events
/// are delivered by whichever thread is dispatching: usually the submitter
/// before its call returns, but under concurrency possibly another thread,
/// after the submit returned. A listener may observe a book state newer
/// than its event, and may re-enter the book (its nested call's events are
/// delivered after the current batch). See [`TradeListener`] for the
/// details and [`Self::dropped_listener_events`] /
/// [`Self::listener_panics`] for the panicking-listener accounting.
///
/// # Caller-supplied code
///
/// `T` (`Clone`, `Default`, and whatever else the caller's type carries)
/// and every listener are caller code the crate cannot certify. They must
/// not panic. `T::default()` / `T::clone()` run at the book's boundary
/// (order conversion, snapshots), not inside pricelevel's matcher. A
/// `Clock`, the metrics recorder and the `tracing` subscriber also run
/// under the submit gate, mid-mutation. A panic in any of them unwinds out
/// of the calling entry point, and if that entry point held either side of
/// the submit gate the book engages its kill switch before releasing it
/// (see [`Self::submit_gate_poisoned`]). See `doc/panic-boundaries.md`.
