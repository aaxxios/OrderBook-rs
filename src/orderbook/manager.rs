//! Multi-book management with centralized trade event routing.
//!
//! This module provides book management through a trait-based design, with implementations
//! for both standard library (`BookManagerStd`) and Tokio (`BookManagerTokio`) channels.
//!
//! # Trade processor lifecycle (#255)
//!
//! Both managers route every trade of every managed book through one
//! channel to a single trade processor, and expose the same lifecycle:
//!
//! - `start_trade_processor()` / `start_trade_processor_with(handler)` start
//!   the processor. Failures are typed, never panics: `BookManagerStd`
//!   reports [`ManagerError::ThreadSpawn`] when the OS refuses the thread,
//!   `BookManagerTokio` reports [`ManagerError::NoRuntime`] when called
//!   outside a Tokio runtime (or use `start_trade_processor_on` with an
//!   explicit [`tokio::runtime::Handle`]). A failed start consumes nothing
//!   and can be retried.
//! - `stop_trade_processor()` signals the processor, lets it handle every
//!   event queued before the signal, and joins it (`BookManagerStd`) or
//!   awaits its `JoinHandle` (`BookManagerTokio`). A processor that
//!   panicked is reported as [`ManagerError::ProcessorPanicked`]; a Tokio
//!   task that was cancelled as [`ManagerError::ProcessorCancelled`].
//! - `dropped_trade_events()` counts trade events a listener could not
//!   deliver because the processor is gone (stopped, or panicked). The
//!   first drop is logged at `ERROR` once per manager instead of once per
//!   event; with the `metrics` feature each drop also increments
//!   `orderbook_manager_trade_events_dropped_total`.

/// are produced.

///
/// [`stop_trade_processor`](Self::stop_trade_processor) is the explicit
