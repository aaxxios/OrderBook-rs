//! Mass cancel operations for bulk order removal.
//!
//! Provides efficient methods to cancel multiple orders at once based on
//! various criteria: all orders, by side, by user ID, or by price range.
//! These are critical exchange operations for risk management, market maker
//! position unwinding, and administrative actions.
//!
//! The scoped mass cancels and expiry eviction reuse the single-order
//! `cancel_order` path, ensuring consistent listener notifications, risk
//! release, special-order tracker cleanup, and empty price-level removal;
//! `cancel_all_orders` empties the book in bulk. Every mass cancel holds the
//! exclusive side of the submit gate, and none of them swallows a failure:
//! see [`MassCancelFailure`] (#248).

/// A failure recorded by a mass cancel operation instead of being swallowed.
///
/// Three kinds of failure exist, and they mean different things for the book:
///
/// - [`Self::LevelUnreadable`] is a **refusal**. Every mass cancel that
///   walks price levels (`cancel_all_orders`, `cancel_orders_by_side`,
///   `cancel_orders_by_price_range`) reads each level's resting orders
///   through the fallible `PriceLevel::snapshot_by_seq_into` (pricelevel
///   0.10). The read phase runs before any order is cancelled, and a level
///   that cannot be read makes the whole call cancel **nothing**: a partial
///   bulk cancel whose skipped orders are invisible in the journaled payload
///   would be worse than a refused one. See [`MassCancelResult::is_refused`].
/// - [`Self::OrderCancelFailed`] is a **per-order** failure (#248). The
///   scoped mass cancels remove orders one at a time through the
///   single-order cancel path; an order whose price level refuses the
///   removal stays resting and fully tracked (location, user index, risk,
///   order state), the failure is recorded here, and the call carries on
///   with the next order. Such a result can therefore carry cancelled ids
///   **and** failures.
/// - [`Self::LevelFaultAfterRemoval`] is a per-order **fault report**: the
///   level removed the order and then failed. The order was cancelled, is
///   listed in the cancelled ids, and the book completed its removal.
///
/// Failures are recorded in the call's deterministic traversal order, the
/// same order as [`MassCancelResult::cancelled_order_ids`].
