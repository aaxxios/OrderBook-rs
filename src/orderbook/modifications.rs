    ///   [`CancelBoth`](crate::orderbook::stp::STPMode::CancelBoth), which
    ///   would cancel the re-added order (#168).
    /// - [`OrderBookError::ReserveResidualWouldBeDiscarded`] when the
    ///   projected order is a `ReserveOrder` with `auto_replenish == false`
    ///   and a non-empty hidden tranche, and the depth it would cross is at
    ///   least its visible tranche but less than its total: the re-add's

    ///   discarded, destroying the order (#230). Crossing into depth
    ///   smaller than the visible tranche is allowed (the residual rests
    ///   with a positive visible tranche), and so is a projected full fill
    ///   (it discards nothing).
    ///
    /// # What the gate covers
    ///
    /// The gate mode is chosen **before** anything is read, from
    /// `strandable_makers_resting` and

    /// which could go stale between the lookup and the acquisition. The
    /// guard is then held across the *whole* operation: the order lookup,
    /// the shared shape validator, both pre-checks, the cancel and the
    /// re-add. Nothing is decided from state read outside it.
    ///
    /// On a book holding strandable makers, or with STP engaged, that mode
    /// is exclusive, so for the case the second pre-check exists to protect
    /// — re-pricing a non-replenishing reserve that carries hidden quantity
    /// — the crossable-depth dry run is **exact**: no concurrent mutation
    /// can move the opposite side between the estimate and the re-add's
    /// sweep, so such a re-price cannot destroy the order it modifies.
    /// On a book holding none, a re-price of some *other* order runs
    /// shared, where the #168 self-cross dry run keeps its existing
    /// best-effort character.
    ///
    /// # Failed re-adds (#240, #247)
    ///
    /// A re-price that crosses while the book's trade-id generator is
    /// exhausted is refused in the validate-first phase, **before** the
    /// original is cancelled: the original keeps resting and the call
    /// returns `PriceLevelError(CapacityExceeded)` (reject code 16).
    ///
    /// The re-add takes the validate-first verdict as its admission: it
    /// does not re-run the kill-switch, risk-limit or shape checks, so a
    /// kill switch engaged, a clock tick or a risk limit consumed between

    /// gate (the id taken by another submit, a post-only now crossing) or a
    /// resource the book cannot observe beforehand (a price level that
    /// fails, a refused allocation). The outcome depends on whether the
    /// re-added order traded first:
    ///
    /// - **Nothing traded**: the original is restored and the call returns
    ///   [`OrderBookError::ModifyRolledBack`] carrying the re-add's error.
    ///   It rests again with the same id, price, quantity (as it was when
    ///   cancelled) and timestamp, and its order state is restored, but at
    ///   the **back** of its price level's queue: pricelevel assigns a new
    ///   insertion sequence and offers no way to reinstate the old one, so
    ///   time priority is lost. The cancel and re-add events were emitted.
    /// - **Nothing traded and the restore failed too**: the order is gone.
    ///   The call returns [`OrderBookError::ModifyOrderLost`] with
    ///   `restore_error` set; the indices hold no trace of the order and its
    ///   state is `Cancelled { reason: RestFailed }` (unless another live
    ///   order now owns the id). The restore only rests, never matches: if
    ///   the original's price now crosses or locks the best opposite price
    ///   (an opposite order arrived after the cancel), it is refused with
    ///   `PriceCrossing` rather than letting the engine lock the book.
    /// - **The re-add traded, then failed**: its trades are real and the
    ///   original cannot be restored. A sweep aborted by a failed level
    ///   returns [`OrderBookError::MatchAborted`] as before; any other
    ///   failure (the residual could not be rested, self-trade prevention
    ///   cancelled the remainder) returns [`OrderBookError::ModifyOrderLost`]
    ///   with the executed quantity. The remainder never rests and the
    ///   order ends in a terminal state.
