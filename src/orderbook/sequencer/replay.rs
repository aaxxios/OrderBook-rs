/// Compares two [`OrderBookSnapshot`]s for structural equality.
///
/// Two snapshots are considered equal when:
/// - `symbol` is identical
/// - The sorted bid price levels match, and the sorted ask price levels
///   match — where "match" means the **complete** per-level state (#208):
///   price, visible quantity, hidden quantity, order count, the full order
///   vector in queue-consumption order, and the deterministic execution
///   statistics.
///
/// This is the equality oracle for replay correctness. Aggregate-only
/// comparison (price / quantities / order count, #102) was a subset check:
/// two books with the same aggregates but reversed maker FIFO — or the same
/// FIFO with different maker ids, users, order variants, quantities, or
/// time-in-force — would emit different trades on the next sweep yet still
/// compare equal. Since pricelevel 0.9 the snapshot's `orders()` vector is
/// materialized in queue-consumption order, so element-wise [`crate::OrderType`]
/// equality pins maker identity and FIFO exactly.
///
/// Order equality includes the admission timestamp: the journal carries the
/// admitted order verbatim — timestamp baked in — and replay re-installs it
/// without re-stamping, so a faithful replay reproduces order timestamps
/// byte-identically (under any clock). Verifying against a book whose
/// orders were constructed and clock-stamped independently of the journal
/// will (correctly) report a mismatch.
///
/// Statistics comparison covers the deterministic counters — orders added /
/// removed / executed, quantity executed, value executed, and the sticky
/// `stats_degraded` flag. Intentionally excluded:
/// - `first_arrival_time` — before pricelevel 0.10 it came from a raw
///   `SystemTime::now()` at level creation; since 0.10 it starts at `0` and
///   is stamped from order timestamps, so it is deterministic, but it stays
///   excluded because snapshots written by older versions carry wall-clock
///   values;
/// - `last_execution_time` / `sum_waiting_time` — clock-derived, but live
///   ingestion and replay consume different clock-tick budgets by design
///   (the live submission API stamps each order with a fresh tick; replay
///   reuses the journal's pre-stamped order), so these wall-time aggregates
///   diverge even under identically-seeded injected clocks;
/// - the top-level snapshot capture timestamp, as before.
///
/// # Execution statistics and concurrent takers (#241)
///
/// The compared execution counters (`orders_executed`, `quantity_executed`,
/// `value_executed`, `stats_degraded`) are only coherent under pricelevel
/// 0.10's single-writer contract, and a live book lets shared-gate takers
/// sweep one level concurrently (see `OrderBook`'s "Level statistics are
/// advisory under concurrent takers"). The comparison stays exact anyway,
/// and is kept, for two reasons:
///
/// - **The replayed side has one writer.** Replay applies journal events
///   one at a time on the calling thread, so every level of the replayed
///   book has at most one `record_execution` in flight and its snapshot
///   never holds a partial execution.
/// - **The live side's totals are exact once quiescent.** Overlapping
///   recorders leave arithmetically exact final totals (atomic checked
///   updates, exact rollbacks), and the live book executes the same fills
///   per level as the replay, so a live snapshot taken with no sweep in
///   flight carries the same counters.
///
/// The caller's obligation is therefore to take `expected` while no sweep
/// is in flight on the live book, which a replay oracle needs regardless:
/// a snapshot captured mid-sweep does not correspond to any journal prefix
/// (its order vectors are mid-sweep too). A false divergence reported
/// against such a snapshot is a capture-timing error, not a replay fault;
/// dropping the counters would not make the comparison meaningful and would
/// hide a real under-count (`stats_degraded`) or a lost fill. One residual:
/// if a level's counters reach exhaustion, which execution gets dropped can
/// depend on the live interleaving, and the two sides may then legitimately
/// differ.
///
/// Note this tightening is a contract change for external consumers: two
/// independently built books with equal aggregates but different maker
/// identity or FIFO used to compare equal (pre-#208) and no longer do —
/// that laxity was the #102/#208 correctness gap, not a feature.
